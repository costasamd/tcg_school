This is meant to be an web app that will allow for the user to choose what TCG game he/she plays or wish to learn,
then display the options to see the cards, the rules, gameplays, register their cards and build up their collection, then be able to create or get suggestion about possible decks
using cards from the collection only.
It will also display all crads availiable in the game.
